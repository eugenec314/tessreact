This is a fork of tesseract-ocr, to allow contributors to make small changes. Since people mainaining this project will be the same as for the tesseract-ocr project, the support will most likely be very low.

Also, this project is not aiming to really improve the existing yet, it's mostly for documentation contributions to be appended to the read-only project.
